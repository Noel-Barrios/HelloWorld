        // everything in React is a component, and these usually take the form of JavaScript classes.
        // You can create a component by extending upon the React-Component class.
        class Hello extends React.Component {

                // The reason we're writing {this.props.message} with curly braces is because we need to tell the JSX
                // that we want to add a JavaScript expression.  This is called "escaping"

        // Handling data:  there are two types of data in React: props and state.  
        // The Key difference is that state is private and can be changed from within the component itself.
        // Props are external, and not controlled by the component itself.  It's passed down from components'
        // higher up the hierarchy, who also control the data.
